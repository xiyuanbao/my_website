# Biography

Hi, I am Xiyuan Bao, a senior undergraduate in [USTC](http://en.ustc.edu.cn) majoring in geophysics, supervised by Pro. [Wei Leng](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=mM6zRxUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Also I am minoring in CS and will receive a certificate for half credits of second degree in 2018. My research centers around geodynamic modeling. This summer I was transferred to Pro. [Lijun Liu](https://www.geology.illinois.edu/cms/One.aspx?portalId=127672&pageId=230146)'s group at UIUC, dedicated to constrain the nature of LLSVPs using observed geoid and dynamic topography. Meanwhile, as the leader of a National Innovation Program, my role is to examine the possibility of certain origin of LLSVPs together with another teammate. Next I will work on benchmark of my mentor Wei Leng's code Citcom-Ellipsis(originated from [Citcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citcom) & [Ellipsis](http://www.geodynamics.org/cig/software/ellipsis3d/)).

I got good grades in most of my specialized courses, and I believe coding is a powerful tool to realize my ideas, that's why I choose half of the courses in CS degree. Please see [Grades]({{< ref "grade/grade.md" >}}) or {{% staticref "cv/cv.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}} for more details.

I love geodynamics, since it tells stories: through millions of years or even longer, how mantle convection leads to earth's interior structure, geologic phenomena and plate tectonics, such as earthquakes, volcano eruption, faulting, seafloor spreading mountain building and plumes. When confronting a complex problem, geodynamics offers me a higher perspectiveâ€”it covers every field in geophysics, for instance, to probe a internal activity , we may need to measure geoid, geomagnetism, seismic wave velocity as well as mineralogy of rocks and their isotopic composition, and they are exactly what I have been exposed to during the last few years in USTC.
