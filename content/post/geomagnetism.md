[Westward drift of the non-dipole part](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/243/859/67) is nature of great importance of the Geomagnetic field. In the class:Theory of Geoelectricity and Geomagnetism we were asked to visualize this trend. Using spherical harmonic coefficients from [IGRF](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html) (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) up to 12 degree I was able to plot the z component of non-dipole field from 1900 to 2015 with Matlab and combine them in a GIF, you can see the drift is very obvious.
