Origin of the two LLSVPs inside the lower mantle is heavily debated,from purely thermal to purely compositional. These features are presumably very important for modulating Earthâ€™s long-term evolution such as the main heat source for generating mantle plumes and surface volcanism. We want to place better constraints on these mantle structures through examining their geodynamic properties.
