Compared to earlier softwares, Citcom-Ellipsis can provide better performance to solve mantle convetive problems, e.g. with this new code you are able to explore viscoelasticity and use Lagrange particle tracking to probe deformation.

After debugging, benchmark work is now needed. Currently I am reading papers about the core of Citcom and Ellipsis, including finite element algorithm and effects of different viscosity on convection.
